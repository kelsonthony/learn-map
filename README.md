How array works in JS

1. How the for works
2. How forEach works
3. How Map works


# Console Out
Learn map
Method For
my arr [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
my array with for 1
my array with for 2
my array with for 3
my array with for 4
my array with for 5
my array after for [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
Method forEach
my var sum before forEach 0
my var sum after forEach 10
my var sum after forEach 20
my var sum after forEach 30
my var sum after forEach 40
my var sum after forEach 50
my var sum after forEach again 50
forEach changes the original array
Method Map
my array before map [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
my array after map [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
my Mymap [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ]
Can you see? my original array still the same [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
